1.When writing an gcc command in the makefile, there must be an tab before the command
2.When finish the makefile, then type "make" in the shell, which will execute the first command in the makefile(not a right rule)
3.But when I test it myself, I found that I can add three diffrent commands(two diffenrent gcc commands and one echo commands) in the file and use simple "make" command in the shell and execute them all.
