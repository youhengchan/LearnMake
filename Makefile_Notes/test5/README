%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

hellomake: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS)

In this version, we find a new anotation in the Makefile -> "$^"

Actually, the two different symbol -> "$@" and "$^" mean the either size of 
 the ":", "$@" means the left side, while "$^" means the right side

For instance, in line ->  %.o: %.c $(DEPS)

the line after it $(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS) means 

           gcc -c -o %.o %.c $(DEPS) -I . 

The next level will make compiling looks more abstract but more clear
In test6, we will devid all the source code into different subdirectoies
1. src -> .cxx 
2. lib -> all libraries
3. obj -> all object files
4. include -> all header files

The directory structure look like bellow:
 ----|      
     |---include/
     |---src/ 
          |---Makefile
          |---obj/
